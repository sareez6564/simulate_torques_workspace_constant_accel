# simulate_torques_workspace_constant_accel
# Content
The model provides the required torque, depending on joint angle position, velocity and acceleration input parameters, as well as, the moving vehicle (base) acceleration input parameter.
The acceleration input of the base is set to a constant acceleration.
The results can be viewed numerically in a table, in the command window, by first running the simulation in Simulink and, afterwards, running the MATLAB script.
